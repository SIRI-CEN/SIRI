Changes to  SIRI schema v2.0   since v1.4

 2015.05.13 Bug fix (from french feedback) SIRI 2.0p
	* replacement of "NotifyExtension" (appearing 10 times) with "SiriExtension" in siri_wsConsumer.wsdl in order to ensure compatibility with the Document version

 2015.05.13 Bug fix (from SG7 feedback) SIRI 2.0o
 	* update annotation in siri.xsd and and siri_all_functionalService.xsd (to add <Requires> siri__facilityMonitoring_service.xsd ...)
	* siri.xsd: move of a SituationExchangeDelivery, renamed IncludedSituationExchangeDelivery, before other complemented service deliveries.
	* siri_situationExchange_service.xsd: addition of IncludedSituationExchangeDelivery element

 2015.05.11 Bug fix (from SG7 skype meeting on May 11th 2015) SIRI 2.0o
 	* Allow multiple tags within an extension (reapply lost chnage from 2012.06.18 SIRI 2.0d) - siri_utility-v1.1.xsd
	* siri_estimatedVehicleJourney-v2.0.xsd : in EstimatedTimetableAlterationGroup, addition of FramedVehicleJourneyRef as an alternative to DatedVehicleJourneyRef (choice) and deprecation of DatedVehicleJourneyRef and EstimatedVehicleJourneyCode
	* siri_datedVehicleJourney-v2.0.xsd : DatedVehicleJourneyCode is now optional
	* siri.xsd: SituationExchangeDelivery now can be provided as a complement to any other Service delivery (and can still be provided standalone)... note that the SituationExchangeDelivery must be after the other Delivery to get a validating, non-ambiguous XSD.
	* siri_estimatedVehicleJourney-v2.0.xsd : EstimatedVehicleJourneyStructure brought back to SIRI 2.0k situation
		* Replacement of EstimatedJourneyInfoGroup by JourneyEndTimesGroup 
		* Replacement of inclusion of siri_journey-v2.0.xsd by siri_monitoredVehicleJourney-v2.0.xsd

=====================================
2007 10  17 
      Add Situation Exchange & Facility Exchange services. x tx
      Added a  siri_all-v1.2.xsd, ifopt_allStopPlace-v0.3.xsd, acsp_all.xsd packages to force explicit declaration of all elements in an imported namespace on the first reference. This overcomes a limitation of some XML tools that only pick up thos elements on the first import and ignotre all subsequent imports.
